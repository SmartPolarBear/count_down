## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
This is a simple count-down app built with Jetopack Compose. It can generate a notification after a user-defined time duration.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
As a developer with no experience working with Android, I learn how to build an app from scratch with Jetpack Compose right after I am attracted by the concept of declarative UI and finally achieved to build this in a week.
